      <h3>Early Days</h3>
<article>Iwata was born on December 6, 1959. He showed interest in gaming and development from a young age, obtaining a programmable calculator in high school and using it to make several simple games. In 1978, he entered the Tokyo Institute of Technology and majored in computer science.</article>

    <h3>Bridge to Nintendo</h3>
<article>As a student, Iwata worked at HAL Laboratory as a part-time programmer. He soon graduated and became a full time developer at HAL in 1982, pushing his programming skills to new heights. he became the coordinator of software production at HAL and used his position to push a deep relationship with Nintendo. This secured HAL's role in the production of several games - including Balloon Fight, Earthbound, and Kirby's Adventure - for the popular new Nintendo Entertainment System. Thanks to his passion, persistence, and skill, Iwata was promoted to the president of HAL in 1993 and was able to pull the company out of debt. Even while acting as president, he continued his programming work and played a pivotal role in bringing the now hugely popular Pokémon franchise to Western households.</article>

    <h3>A Revitalizing Wind at Nintendo</h3>
    <article>Iwata took a corporate position at Nintendo in 2000, and was promoted to president of the company by 2002 when Hiroshi Yamauchi retired. At this time, Nintendo's Gamecube and N64 consoles had not been performing well compared to their competitors. In addition, the atmosphere at Nintendo stifled employees, with Yamauchi practicing a strict, distant style. He sought to bring a new level of openness and communication to the company, meeting directly with every employee and encouraging them to be creative. If they disagreed with Iwata, he suggested they find a solution of their own and take risks rather than forcing obedience.</article>

    <h3>Bringing Games to Everyone</h3>
<article>From 2002 to 2004, Iwata focused heavily on restructuring Nintendo's goals. He noted that interest in video games was declining. Developers were focusing soley on pushing expensive, advanced hardware and trying to appeal to a small core of niche players. "Games have come to a dead end", said Iwata. He pushed a new, bold direction: Nintendo would focus on the "blue ocean" of potential players that existing efforts weren't captivating, as well as produce interesting, unique hardware and games rather than cutting-edge technical pieces.
With this in mind, Iwata oversaw the development of two new consoles - the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii. The DS, released in 2004, would be a portable system containing two screens with emphasis on touchscreen capabilities that were brand new at the time. With this novel appeal and games such as Brain Age which focused on appealing to non-gamers, the DS went on to be a massive success, ultimately selling over 154 million units. The Wii, released in 2006, pursed a similar strategy. Rather than touting portable touchscreen capability, it was a home console that focused on revolutionary new motion control systems. It was a similarly massive success, bringing the fun of video games to millions of new players and selling over 101 million units. These consoles were responsible for massively expanding the appeal of video games to millions of new players, and ushered in a new era of success for Nintendo.</article>

    <h3>Later Years</h3>
<article id="last">Iwata continued work at Nintendo throughout his life, guiding the company through the release of the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS systems as well as playing a key role in the development of the new hit console, the Nintendo Switch. Unfortunately, he fell ill in 2014 due to a tumor in his bile duct. He continued his work until July 11, 2015, when he passed away due to problems caused by the tumor. His death brought an outpouring of support from the millions of people who had their lives brightened by his work.</article>
